    "procedure": [
      "Ensure the melting point apparatus is clean and switched OFF.",
      "Fill the capillary tube with finely powdered sample.",
      "Place the capillary tube in the heating block.",
      "Switch ON the apparatus and start heating gradually.",
      "Observe the temperature at which the sample starts melting.",
      "Record the melting point range.",
      "Switch OFF the apparatus after use."
