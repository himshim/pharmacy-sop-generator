      "Ensure the FTIR instrument is clean and free from dust.",
      "Switch ON the instrument and allow it to stabilize.",
      "Prepare the sample using suitable method (e.g., KBr pellet or ATR).",
      "Place the background sample and record background spectrum.",
      "Place the test sample in the sample holder.",
      "Record the FTIR spectrum.",
      "Save and interpret the spectrum as required."
